## Challenges and Solutions

During the development of this portfolio website, I encountered several challenges that required creative problem-solving and perseverance. Here are a few notable challenges and the solutions I implemented:

1. **Smooth Scrolling Implementation**: Achieving smooth scrolling behavior across different browsers and devices was a challenge. To overcome this, I utilized the Locomotive Scroll library, which provided a consistent and performant solution for smooth scrolling.

2. **Responsive Design**: Creating a responsive layout that adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes and devices was crucial. I leveraged CSS media queries and responsive design techniques to ensure an optimal viewing experience on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

3. **Animation Performance**: Incorporating animations and interactive elements while maintaining smooth performance was a concern. I optimized the code by lazy-loading non-critical resources and leveraging browser APIs like Intersection Observer to improve performance.

4. **Cross-browser Compatibility**: Ensuring consistent appearance and functionality across different browsers required extensive testing and debugging. I utilized modern web standards, vendor prefixes, and polyfills to address compatibility issues.

5. **Accessibility**: Making the website accessible to users with disabilities was a priority. I followed best practices for accessibility, including proper use of semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, and keyboard navigation support.
